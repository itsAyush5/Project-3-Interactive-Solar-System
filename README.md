<h1>Interactive 3D Solar System Explorer</h1>
Embark on a virtual journey through our solar system with this fully interactive 3D simulation. Built with vanilla JavaScript and the powerful three.js library, this project offers a visually engaging and educational experience that runs entirely in your browser with zero installation required.
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Features : </strong></li>
</ul>
1) Dynamic 3D Environment: Explore a beautifully rendered model of the Sun and all eight planets, each with distinct colors and relative sizes.
2) Immersive Parallax Starfield: The background is composed of multiple layers of stars that move at different speeds, creating a convincing illusion of depth and a vast, dynamic cosmos.
3) Data-Rich Exploration: Hover your cursor over any celestial body (including the Sun) to display a tooltip with fascinating facts and real-world data, such as its diameter and actual orbital speed.
4) Granular Orbit Control: The intuitive side panel allows you to:
View each planet's true orbital speed.
Individually adjust the animation speed of each planet using a multiplier.
Pause, resume, and reset the entire simulation to its natural state.
5) Intuitive Camera Navigation:
Orbit/Rotate: Click and drag with the left mouse button.
Zoom: Use the mouse scroll wheel for a closer or wider view.
6) Zero-Setup Required: As a self-contained HTML file using a CDN for three.js, this project requires no build process, package installation, or web server. It just works.
<ul><li><strong>Launching the Simulation : </strong></li></ul>
This project is designed for maximum simplicity. It is a single HTML file that runs in any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
<br><br>
Method 1: Direct File Access (Easiest)
Save the complete HTML code into a file named index.html on your computer.
Open your web browser.
Press Ctrl+O (on Windows/Linux) or Cmd+O (on macOS) to open the file browser.
Navigate to and select the index.html file you just saved.
Alternatively, you can simply drag the index.html file icon from your desktop or file manager and drop it into an open browser window.
<br><br>
Method 2: Using a Local Server (For Developers)
If you have a code editor like VS Code with the Live Server extension, you can run it for an experience with automatic browser reloading on code changes.
Place the index.html file in a project folder.
Open the folder in your code editor.
Right-click the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" (or your editor's equivalent).
